# U3A Course Management

This code all resides at https://github.com/westborn/U3A-Course-Spreadsheet
It started out as separate repositories for each Term but we've moved to a single repository with bracnches for each term.

The main branch will be for the active term.
Other branches will be created, usually at the end of a Term,
to capture the state of the code for histroical purposes.

This file is always attached to a google sheet and the ID must be registered in the **clasp.json** file  
The ID is found by:

- opening the spreadsheet
- select 'Extensions' from the menu
- select 'Apps Script'
- copy the script ID from the URL in the address bar

OK, moving on...
